## Description

This repository is for a that notebook explains how to make a PCA scatter plot 
typically used in ancient human population genetics in R, using the `tidyverse` 
collection of packages. 

The notebook is aimed at those who are pretty new to R, but have a basic 
knowledge of how things work (e.g. how to assign a variable, a general idea of 
what a vector is, how to install a R library).

To view the notebook please see the [`.md` file](https://github.com/jfy133/Tidy_PopGen_PCA_Plotting/blob/master/Tidy_PopGen_PCA_Plotting.md).

To run the notebook yourself, please clone (i.e. download) the repository to 
your own computer using the command below, and run within the `.Rmd` file in 
Rstudio. 

```
git clone https://github.com/jfy133/Tidy_PopGen_PCA_Plotting.git
```

You will need to install the packages listed at the beginning of the notebook.
Or, even better install the entire tidyverse with `install.packages("tidyverse")`
